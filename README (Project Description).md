# Stock Data Analysis and Visualization for Investment Insights
In this project I demonstrate skills in extracting data from various sources (yfinance, web scraping) and visualizing data on the example of Tesla and GameStop stocks. 

## Detailed Project Description:
In this project, I took on the role of a Data Scientist/Data Analyst at a startup investment firm. I utilized Python libraries and web scraping techniques to gather financial data, including historical stock prices and quarterly revenue reports, for popular stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

I then analyzed this data and extracted key performance indicators (KPIs). Using Plotly, I created visualizations and a dashboard to clearly present these KPIs and identify potential patterns or trends that could inform investment strategies.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:
* Data extraction using Python libraries (yfinance) and web scraping;
* Data analysis and identification of key performance indicators;
* Data visualization using Plotly;
* Dashboard creation to present insights effectively.

## Environment & Tools:
* Skills Network Labs;
* Google Colab
* Python libraries: yfinance, Plotly, pandas.

*Note: This project was completed as part of a course, and the evaluation included hands-on labs, quizzes, and a peer review assignment.*
